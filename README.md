# FUTURE_DS_03
In this project, interns will analyze text and rating-based feedback submitted by students after attending campus events. You’ll work with simulated or real Google Forms data (CSV) and use basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

Student Feedback Analysis:

Overview:

Analyze student feedback from college events using Python, pandas, and visualizations to find insights and improve future events.

Dataset: 

File: student feedback.csv

Contains numeric ratings (1–5) for event aspects like clarity, content, and overall satisfaction.

Project Steps:

1. Load the CSV in Google Colab

2. Select numeric columns for analysis

3. Calculate average ratings per question

4. Create bar charts and pie charts for visualization

5. Identify highest and lowest rated questioN
